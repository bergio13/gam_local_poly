# GAM with Local Polynomials and Predictor Importance Analysis using LOCO

This project was completed for the *"Statistical Learning"* course in the Data Science Master's program at *Sapienza University of Rome*. It involves implementing a **Generalized Additive Model (GAM)** using **Local Polynomials** and analyzing predictor importance through the **Leave-One-Covariate-Out (LOCO)** score. 

Our approach scored **4th** place out of 23 teams in the course's *Kaggle* competition, focused on a redshift prediction problem.

## Project Overview
- Objective: Develop a GAM with locally estimated polynomial smoothers to capture non-linear relationships in the data, and assess predictor importance using LOCO.
- Competition: Redshift prediction problem on Kaggle, where the model's interpretability and predictive performance were critical.
