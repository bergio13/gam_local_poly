# GAM with Local Polynomials and Predictor Importance study using LOCO

Project for the course *"Statistical Learning"* of the Master Degree in Data Science at *Sapienza University of Rome*.

Implementation of **Generalized Additive Model (GAM)** with **Local Polynomials** and study of predictor importance with **LOCO** score. 

With our implementation we scored **4th** place out of the 23 teams participating in the course *Kaggle* competition on a redshift prediction problem.
