# GAM with Local Polynomials and Predictor Importance study using LOCO

Project for the course *"Statistical Learning"* of the Master Degree in Data Science at *Sapienza University of Rome*.

Implementation of Generalized Additive Model (GAM) with Local Polynomials and study of predictor importance with LOCO score. 

With our implementation we scored 4th place out of the 23 teams participating in the course Kaggle competition on a prediction problem.
